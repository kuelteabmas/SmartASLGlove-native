# American Sign Language Translator

An effective communication aide between the deaf/mute and non-deaf/mute needs to be accurate, accessible, and easy to use. Our idea was to design and create a glove for deaf/mute people that can translate sign language to communicate faster and more easily with the vast majority of people that are not well versed in sign language. The glove would translate the sign language gestures into text form according to the American Sign Language Standards. This text would be displayed on the screen of a mobile device such as a smartphone through a custom application. From here all the non-deaf/mute person has to do is read the text translation to understand what is meant to be communicated. 

The smartphone app contains the bulk of the actually processes for use and upkeep of the system. The app will use our custom ASL Library to interpret the movements and gestures it receives from the gloves and translate them into English text. The app will then use the translated text in a text-to-speech process to achieve an audio output of the translation that is played through the speakers of the phone. Aside from the main functionality of the app, it is also planned as a source for pushing software and library updates to the main system for easy maintenance.
